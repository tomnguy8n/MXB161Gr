# TODO List

## Issues

### 1. Change Infection Calculation Method ??
- **Description**: My code currently uses Euclidean distance to determine infection spread. Update the code to use Moore neighborhood for infection.
- **Status**: Open
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Research Moore neighborhood and its implementation.
  - [ ] Update the infection calculation logic in the simulation code.
  - [ ] Test the updated code.
  - [ ] Verify results and compare with previous implementation.
### 2. Implement Variation of Infection Radius
- **Description**: infection radius implementation is still very primitive meaning as long as it is in the infection radius it has the same infection probability.
- **Status**: Open
- **Tasks**:
 - [ ] Think about it more lol.
 - [ ] Implement a prototype.
 - [ ] See how the infection radius is going to work with variation in value (having overlaying infection radius affecting the probability)
 - [ ] Compare it with expected scenario ?
### 3. Improving Immunity/Recovery State
- **Description**: The immunity is still complete immunity for set number of days instead of probability based immunity
- **Status**:Open
- **Task**:
 - [ ] Still don't know what to do with this yet
### 4. Improving Random walks
- **Description**: Random walks is still primitive need to be improve
- **Status**:Open
- **Task**:
 - [ ] possible implementation: bias random walks, random walks on already define pattern, corelated random walks ??
 - [ ] implement a path tracer for 1 particle to check if needed
 - [ ] implementation time
 - [ ] compare to human trajectory in some closed space ?
